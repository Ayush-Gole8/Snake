# 🔧 Speedy Snake Showdown - Bug Fixes & Solutions

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **404 Error for shared/constants.js**
**Problem:** The shared constants file was not being served by the Express server.

**Solution:** Added a specific route to serve shared files:
```javascript
// Serve shared files from shared directory
app.use('/shared', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../shared')));
```

**Files Modified:** `server/server.js`

### 2. **MIME Type Error for JavaScript Files**
**Problem:** Browser was refusing to execute JavaScript due to incorrect MIME type.

**Solution:** Set proper MIME type for JavaScript files:
```javascript
// Set proper MIME types
express.static.mime.define({'application/javascript': ['js']});
```

**Files Modified:** `server/server.js`

### 3. **404 Error for favicon.ico**
**Problem:** Browser was requesting favicon.ico which didn't exist.

**Solution:** Added favicon route to prevent 404 errors:
```javascript
// Favicon endpoint
app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => {
    res.status(204).end();
});
```

**Files Modified:** `server/server.js`, `client/favicon.ico` (created)

### 4. **Incorrect Path Reference in HTML**
**Problem:** HTML was referencing constants with incorrect relative path.

**Solution:** Updated script source path:
```html
<!-- Changed from ../shared/constants.js to shared/constants.js -->
<script src="shared/constants.js"></script>
```

**Files Modified:** `client/index.html`
